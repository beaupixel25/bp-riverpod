# Project memory — bp-riverpod

The current state of this workspace, auto-loaded into every session through the
`@MEMORY.md` import in `CLAUDE.md`. `CLAUDE.md` holds the **rules**; this file
holds the **facts**. Keeping it accurate is part of finishing a task.

<!-- ids: R=requirement D=decision G=gotcha S=slice · monotonic · never reused -->

## How to maintain this file

**When.** At the end of every task that changed a file under `packages/`, and
whenever the user states a requirement, you make a design decision, or you lose
time to a trap.

**Stable ids.** `R-<n>` requirement · `D-<n>` decision · `G-<n>` gotcha ·
`S-<n>` prototype slice. Monotonic, never reused, never renumbered — that is
what turns "was this preserved?" into a `grep`.

**Append or edit — one test.**

- The fact describes *how the project is now* → **edit the existing line**.
  Gate: run `grep -in "<subject>" MEMORY.md` first; a hit means edit, not append.
- The fact describes *a change that happened* → **append** one Session Log line.
- A change that contradicts an existing line does **both**: edit the line, then
  append `old -> new` to the Session Log.

**Write mode per section.**

| Section | Mode | May be trimmed? |
|---|---|---|
| Current State | replace in place | yes — it is only ever "now" |
| Feature Map | one row per feature, edit in place | only once the files are gone from disk |
| Component Index | one row per component, edit in place | only once the files are gone from disk |
| Design System | replace in place | yes |
| Prototype Slices | one `###` per slice, edit in place on re-implementation | body only, after a verbatim archive |
| Requirements (`R-`) | append only | **never** |
| Decisions (`D-`) | append only; supersede with a stub | **never** |
| Gotchas (`G-`) | append only; mark "no longer applies" | **never** |
| Session Log | append, newest first | yes — archived, never deleted |

**Trim triggers.** Run both before you finish a memory update:

```bash
wc -l MEMORY.md                                                          # > 400 -> compact
awk '/^## Session Log/{f=1;next} /^## /{f=0} f&&/^- /' MEMORY.md | wc -l  # > 20  -> compact
```

**Compaction pass** — in this order, no shortcuts:

1. Select the Session Log entries older than the newest **10**.
2. **Promote first.** Every durable fact in a selected entry must already exist
   somewhere permanent: a requirement under `## Requirements`, a decision under
   `## Decisions`, a trap under `## Gotchas`, a created file / route / provider /
   component as a row in `## Feature Map` or `## Component Index`. If it is not
   there, put it there now. **Never archive an entry whose durable content has
   not been promoted** — this single rule is what stops trimming from losing
   requirements.
3. Move the selected entries **verbatim and unedited** to the top of
   `.claude/memory/CHANGELOG.md`, under a new
   `## <YYYY-MM-DD> archived from MEMORY.md` heading.
4. Re-run `wc -l MEMORY.md`. Still over 400? Run the reorganize pass.

**Reorganize pass** — only when the curated sections themselves overflow:

- Collapse prose that restates a table row into the row. One row, one line.
- Prototype slices beyond the newest **3**: move the whole `###` section
  verbatim to the changelog and leave a one-line row under
  `### Archived slices` (name · feature path · routes · archive date).
- A superseded decision keeps a one-line stub —
  `- **D-3** — <title> (superseded by D-9; full text in CHANGELOG)` — and only
  its body moves.
- Never merge two gotchas. Never reword a requirement. Never renumber an id.

**Never.**

- Delete an `R-`, `D-` or `G-` entry, or reuse its number.
- Delete a Feature Map or Component Index row while those files exist on disk.
- Edit text while moving it into `.claude/memory/CHANGELOG.md`.
- Let this file pass 400 lines without running the compaction pass.

## Current State
<!-- format: replace in place · keep under 15 lines -->

- **Apps:** `packages/hello`
- **Shared:** `packages/core`
- **State management:** Riverpod 3 — one `@riverpod` controller per page, state as `AsyncValue`
- **`core` exports:** `full` — a single `core.dart` barrel
- **Design system:** a design-system bundle applied at create time
- **Features:** `onboarding` (baseline slice shipped at create time)
- **Last verified:** never — run `melos bs && melos build && melos analyze`

## Feature Map
<!-- format: | feature | app | entity | pages -> routes | use cases | notes | -->

| Feature | App | Entity | Pages → routes | Use cases | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `onboarding` | `hello` | `User` | landing → `/landing`, login → `/login`, signup → `/signup` | Login, Signup | baseline slice from the scaffold; declares its own routes, aggregated by `appRoutes` — `/` and `/main` are app-level, not part of it |

## Component Index
<!-- format: | component | folder under core/lib/src/presentation/components/ | ViewModel? | key ThemeData fields | -->

| Component | Folder | ViewModel | Key `ThemeData` fields |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AmbientBackdrop` | `ambient_backdrop/` | no | ground colour, `List<AmbientWash>` (colour, centre, radius, alpha) |
| `FormMessage` | `form_message/` | no | background, foreground, message style, **icon** (required), radius, padding |
| `FormTextInput<T>` | `form_text_input/` | yes — `FormTextInputViewModel<T>` | decoration, content padding, text style |
| `IconActionButton` | `icon_action_button/` | no | background, icon/disabled icon colour, hover, highlight, size (44), icon size |
| `LabelChip` | `label_chip/` | no | container decoration, label style |
| `LabeledTextField` | `labeled_text_field/` | no | fill, outline, focus ring, cursor, label/text/hint styles, height, radius, `isLabelUppercased` |
| `NavBar` | `nav_bar/` | no | background, active/inactive colour, selected fill, shadow, radius, three paddings, icon size |
| `PasswordField` | `password_field/` | no | none — composes `LabeledTextField`, `IconActionButton` and `PasswordStrengthMeter` |
| `PasswordStrengthMeter` | `password_strength/` | yes — `PasswordStrengthMeterViewModel` | track colour, four ramp colours, label style, track height, label width |
| `PillButton` | `pill_button/` | no | background, foreground, label style, height, radius, padding, border, disabled opacity, pressed scale |
| `PromptLink` | `prompt_link/` | no | prompt style, action style, padding, text align |

Notes an agent needs before editing any of these:

- Every component resolves its colours through its own `<Name>ThemeData`, and
  every `ThemeData` has a `.fallback(context)` deriving from `ColorScheme`,
  `ColorExtension`, `DimensionExtension` and `textTheme`. A literal colour in a
  component is unreachable from a design-system bundle — it survives a rebrand
  and is then the one wrong colour on the screen.
- Each also has a `<Name>Theme` `InheritedWidget` with a
  `static <Name>ThemeData of(BuildContext)`, so a subtree can restyle every
  instance without touching a call site.
- `PasswordStrengthMeter`'s files are `password_strength/meter.dart` and
  `meter_view_model.dart`, not `<name>/<name>.dart` like the others: spelled
  out fully, the export line exceeds 80 characters and trips
  `lines_longer_than_80_chars`.
- Icons come from `AppIcons` and render through `AppIcon`. There is no Material
  glyph fallback and no unicode arrow, chevron or check anywhere in `core`.

## Design System
<!-- format: replace in place -->

A design-system bundle was applied at create time from
`.design-system/bundle.json` — colours, dimensions and typography are already
rendered into `packages/core/lib/src/presentation/theme/`. The bundle's
`components[]` may still be unimplemented; run **import-design-system** to
finish or re-apply it.

## Prototype Slices
<!-- format: newest first · one ### per slice · edit in place on re-implementation -->

_None yet._

<details><summary>Slice entry template — the single source of truth for the format</summary>

```markdown
### S-<n> <Slice name>

- **Source:** <prototype URL> — file `<path/to/File.html>`
- **Type:** page | flow | feature · **Status:** created | updated
- **App / feature:** `packages/<app>/lib/features/<feature>/`
- **File map:** <prototype element> → `<path>`
- **Components:** reused <names>; created <names> (via create-component)
- **Routes added:** `/<page>` (`<Page>Route`)
- **Integration points:** consumes <...>; entered from <...>; shared state <...>
- **Gotchas:** promoted to `## Gotchas` as G-<n>
```

</details>

## Requirements
<!-- append only · NEVER trimmed · id R-<n> -->

- **R-1** — This workspace uses one state-management architecture; every app
  package must match it. It was chosen at create time and is baked into
  `packages/core`.

## Decisions
<!-- append only · NEVER deleted · supersede with a one-line stub · id D-<n> -->

- **D-1** (create time) — Scaffolded with the state-management
  and `core`-export variants recorded above. Changing either afterwards means
  regenerating, not editing.
- **D-2** (create time) — Error envelope: `ApiClient` reads a non-2xx body
  tolerantly and the backend's code beats the status in `AppException.code`.
  Messages are log-only; copy comes from `forCode`, with the type as fallback.
- **D-3** (2026-08-21) — Generated Dart (`*.freezed.dart`, `*.g.dart`) and every
  `build/` directory are gitignored at the workspace root. Codegen output is a
  pure function of the sources plus `melos build`, so committing it only adds
  merge conflicts and unreviewable diff noise.

## Gotchas
<!-- append only · NEVER deleted · id G-<n> -->

- **G-1** — Generated files (`*.g.dart`, `*.freezed.dart`, `routes.g.dart`) are
  build_runner outputs. Hand-editing one is silently reverted by the next
  `melos build`.
- **G-2** — Registering a feature's providers but forgetting
  `...<feature>Overrides(environment)` in `packages/<app>/lib/di/overrides.dart`
  fails **silently**: every flavor, including `test`, keeps the real repository.
  `test/di/overrides_test.dart` is what catches it.
- **G-3** — Parsing a non-2xx body must stay in a `try`/`catch`: a bare
  `jsonDecode` on an HTML error page throws, losing the status and the `code`
  that tells one outage from another in the crash reporter.
- **G-4** — Because of D-3, a fresh clone does not analyze or run until
  `melos bs && melos build` has generated the freezed / json_serializable /
  go_router / riverpod outputs. Hundreds of "undefined class `_$Foo`" errors
  from `melos analyze` on a clean checkout mean codegen has not run, not that
  the tree is broken.

## Session Log
<!-- format: `- <YYYY-MM-DD> <what changed> (skill|manual) -> <where it landed>` -->
<!-- newest first · keep the newest 10 · older entries move verbatim to .claude/memory/CHANGELOG.md -->

- _2026-08-21_ — root `.gitignore`: `/build/` -> unanchored `build/` (the old
  anchored rule missed `packages/core/build/`), plus `*.freezed.dart` and
  `*.g.dart`. Recorded as D-3 / G-4. Three build artifacts committed in the
  initial commit (`packages/core/build/5f4da827.../{.filecache,
  gen_localizations.stamp,outputs.json}`) are still tracked and need
  `git rm -r --cached` to drop.
- _create time_ — workspace scaffolded: `packages/core` plus
  `packages/hello`, baseline `onboarding` feature, eleven `core` components (manual)
  → whole tree
