// Mock repository used in the `test` flavor: a small in-memory account
// store, not a repository that always succeeds or always fails. `signUp`
// registers a new account and `login` checks it against what was stored, so
// the two forms finally relate to each other. Both fail the same way on a bad
// login: an unknown email and a wrong password return the identical
// UnauthorizedException, so neither leaks which one was wrong. The email
// `offline@example.com` is reserved to exercise the one path nothing else in
// a generated app reaches: `guard` mapping a SocketException to a
// NetworkException.//
// Unit tests do not use this class — they fake IOnboardingRepository per
// test via ProviderScope/ProviderContainer overrides. This exists so the
// `test` flavor (main_test.dart) can run the whole app on deterministic data.
